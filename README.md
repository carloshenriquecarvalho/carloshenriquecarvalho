<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I am passionate about building robust, secure, and maintainable applications from the ground up. I am currently self-funding my EAD studies while working as a Data Analyst, which has taught me strong discipline and time management.<br><br> My current focus is a deep-dive into backend architecture by building my bill tracker application (API). I'm building this project in Object-Oriented Java to master the fundamentals.<br><br>My core development philosophy is built on decoupled, secure architecture.<br><br>About the architecture: I'm implementing the MVC to ensure a clean separation of concerns. The Controller handles HTTP/JSON, while the DAO handles all SQL logic.<br><br>Security: My code is built with security first (to prevent SQL Injection).<br><br>For my future: While I'm mastering backend software now, my long-term passion is in Hardware, Robotics, and IoT.</p>
